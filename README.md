# sound_collage_generator
 
this tool converts samples into a kind of sound font that is played back randomly. if enabled, parameter mutation will happen over time, changing the sounds to a varying extent.
you can record the results as a .wav file. unfortunately, sample support is limited to 44100 Hz .wav as well. I hope you will find it useful.
